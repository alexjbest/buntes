    introduction
        p
            | Supersingular isogeny graph crypto is a candidate for post-quantum crypto, not based on factoring etc.

        p
            | Recall last time we defined Ramanujan graphs, graphs with very good connectivity properties, a type of expander.

        proposition
            statement: p
                | If #[m G] is Ramanujan, #[m x\in V, S\subseteq V]. For a sufficiently large path the probability that the path ends in #[m S] is at least #[m |S|/2|G|].
        p
            | Upshot supersingular isogeny graphs are #[m (l +1)]-regular, undirected, Ramanujan, connected.

        p
            | Some of our algorithms are only dependent on having a graph with this property, not so much the interpretation in terms of isogenies.
        p
            | Supersingular isogeny graphs first appeared in crypto as potential hash functions.

            | (2010) (Charles, Goren, Lauter) proposed a cryptographically secure hash function based on the hardness of computing paths in a supersingular isogeny graphs.

        p
            | Cool example, private set intersection, say two groups, Starbucks and BU want to find a list of common customers (students who bought something at Starbucks) but don't want to reveal anything to each other about the students or customers not in the intersection.
            | Compute hashes of the names of customers and share the hashes, can compute the size of, and the intersection itself.
