<p>(Super sketch)</p>
<p>Over a finite field implies there is an ample \(\sheaf L\) with \(\lambda_{\sheaf L}\) a polarization of degree \(d^2\text{,}\) then using above \(\chi(\sheaf L^3) = 3^g d\) and \(\sheaf L^3\) is very ample hence \(\dim H^0(A, \sheaf L^3) = 3^g d\) so we get an embedding into \(\PP^{3^g d - 1}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>The degree of \(A\) in \(\PP^{3^g d - 1}\) is \(((3D)^g) = 3^g d(g!)\) . It is determined by its Chow form, which by these formulae has some (large) bounded degree, as we are over a finite field however there are only finitely many such.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-polarizations-etale.html#proof-45">in-context</a></span>
