<p>Claim: \(\exp\) is injective. There exists a neighborhood \(U\supseteq 0\) s.t. \(\exp(U) \cong U\text{.}\) Consider the image \(\exp(\Tgt_0 A(\CC))\text{.}\) For \(x\in \exp(\Tgt_0 A(\CC))\text{,}\) \(\{U+x\}\) are all open and give a cover. Thus \(\exp(\Tgt_0A(\CC))\) is open. Since \(A(\CC)\) is connected we are thus reduced to showing \(\exp(\Tgt_0 A(\CC))\) is closed also. Since \(\exp\) is a homomorphism, the image is a subgroup. So its complement is the union of its non-trivial cosets, which is open. Thus \(\exp(\Tgt_0A(\CC))\) is closed. Giving \(\exp(\Tgt_0A(\CC)) = A(\CC)\text{,}\) which proves the claim.</p>
