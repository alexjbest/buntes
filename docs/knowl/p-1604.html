<p>From zbmath for serre's Let K be an algebraically closed field of characteristic \(p\gt 0\text{.}\) In the paper Coverings of algebraic curves, Am. J. Math. 79, 825-856 (1957; Zbl 0087.036), S. Abhyankar proved that the automorphism group of an étale Galois cover of the affine line over K is generated by its \(p\)-Sylow subgroups and conjectures that the converse should be true, namely that if a finite group G is generated by its p-Sylow subgroups then there exists an étale Galois cover of the affine line over K with Galois group G. The author proves a weaker form of this conjecture, i.e. the following theorem: Let G be a finite group that is generated by its p-Sylow subgroups, let N be a normal subgroup of G and let G be the quotient group \(G/N\text{.}\) Assume that N is solvable and that G is the Galois group of an étale cover of the affine line. - Under these assumptions there exists an étale Galois cover of the affine line over K with Galois group G. In particular, this result implies Abhyankar’s conjecture for a solvable group.</p>
