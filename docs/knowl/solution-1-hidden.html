<p>Here is what me and Angus think, we have the 2-power frobenius \(\pi\) a degree 2 <a knowl="./knowl/def-supersing-isog-isog.html" title="Definition 3.1.4: Isogenies">isogeny</a> whose square is minus 2, we also have the <a knowl="./knowl/def-supersing-isog-isog.html" title="Definition 3.1.4: Isogenies">isogeny</a> \(\phi \colon x\mapsto \zeta_3 x, y\mapsto y\) which is in fact an automorphism (degree 1) and satisifies \(\phi^2 + \phi + 1 = 0\text{.}\) The relation between these two <a knowl="./knowl/def-supersing-isog-isog.html" title="Definition 3.1.4: Isogenies">isogenies</a> is that \(\pi \phi  = \phi^2 \pi \colon x\mapsto \zeta_3^2 x^2, y\mapsto y^2\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Inside the Huwitz <a knowl="./knowl/def-order-quaternion.html" title="Definition 3.3.14: Orders in quaternion algebras">order</a> we have some candidates for an element whose square is \(-2\) there are a few, coming in two types \(a+ b\) for \(a \ne b \in \{i,j,k\}\) and \(a-b\) for \(a\ne b\in \{i,j,k\}\text{,}\) we choose the second type (why? because it works and the other doesn't), let \(p = i + j\) for concreteness. We also have a cube root of unity in the <a knowl="./knowl/ex-hurwitz-order.html" title="Example 3.3.17: The Hurwitz order">Hurwitz order</a>, it is \(f = (-1 + i + j + k)/2\text{.}\)</p>
<p>We can calculate now what \(pf\) and \(f^2 p\) are, they both come out to be \(- i + k\text{,}\) some other square root of minus 2, which makes sense because degree is multiplicative. Anyway this is consistent with the <a knowl="./knowl/def-supersing-isog-endo.html" title="Definition 3.1.8: Endomorphisms of elliptic curves">endomorphism</a> ring but there is a slight problem, the <a knowl="./knowl/def-order-quaternion.html" title="Definition 3.3.14: Orders in quaternion algebras">order</a> generated here has discriminant \(6\text{,}\) so its non-maximal as we know its contained in the <a knowl="./knowl/ex-hurwitz-order.html" title="Example 3.3.17: The Hurwitz order">Hurwitz order</a> but the discriminant is higher, Deuring tells us we have to get a maximal <a knowl="./knowl/def-order-quaternion.html" title="Definition 3.3.14: Orders in quaternion algebras">order</a> so we need something extra.</p>
