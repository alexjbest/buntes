<p>We can calculate now what \(pf\) and \(f^2 p\) are, they both come out to be \(- i + k\text{,}\) some other square root of minus 2, which makes sense because degree is multiplicative. Anyway this is consistent with the endomorphism ring but there is a slight problem, the order generated here has discriminant \(6\text{,}\) so its non-maximal as we know its contained in the Hurwitz order but the discriminant is higher, Deuring tells us we have to get a maximal order so we need something extra.</p>
