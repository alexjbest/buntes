<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\exp\colon\Tgt_0(A(\CC)) \to A(\CC)

<p data-braille="continuation">this is holomorphic. And since \(A(\CC)\) is abelian, this is a homomorphism also. In general this is locally an isomorphism around 0.</p>
<p>Claim: \(\exp\) is injective. There exists a neighborhood \(U\supseteq 0\) s.t. \(\exp(U) \cong U\text{.}\) Consider the image \(\exp(\Tgt_0 A(\CC))\text{.}\) For \(x\in \exp(\Tgt_0 A(\CC))\text{,}\) \(\{U+x\}\) are all open and give a cover. Thus \(\exp(\Tgt_0A(\CC))\) is open. Since \(A(\CC)\) is connected we are thus reduced to showing \(\exp(\Tgt_0 A(\CC))\) is closed also. Since \(\exp\) is a homomorphism, the image is a subgroup. So its complement is the union of its non-trivial cosets, which is open. Thus \(\exp(\Tgt_0A(\CC))\) is closed. Giving \(\exp(\Tgt_0A(\CC)) = A(\CC)\text{,}\) which proves the claim.</p>
<p>\(\exp\) is a local isomorphism, which gives that \(\ker(\exp)\) is discrete, i.e. a <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def-buntes-lattice.html" title="Definition 5.1.1: Lattices">lattice</a>. We now have</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
A(\CC) \cong \Tgt_0A(\CC)/ \ker(\exp)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">so as \(A(\CC)\) is compact we cannot have a kernel which is not full rank, as otherwise the quotient could not be compact.</p></article></body>
